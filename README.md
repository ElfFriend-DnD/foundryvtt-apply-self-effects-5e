This module applies all Temporary Effects on an Item which targets "self" to the actor owning the item when that item is rolled. If there are effects from the item already on the Actor, but disabled, it will prefer to enable those.

## Compatibility

Requires More Hooks 5e

Super Charged by:
- [Temporary Effects as Token Statuses](https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-temp-effects-as-statuses)
- [Item Effects to Chat](https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-item-effects-to-chat-5e)

Compatible with:
- Core dnd5e roller
- Minimal Rolling Enhancements

Mostly Compatible with:
- DAE
- Better Rolls 5e
- Midi QOL

I'm not actively supporting these so if something breaks, I'm open to a PR but not invested.

If you're using Midi + DAE, it has configuration settings to automatically apply item effects and makes this module redundant.
